This repository is created to store and share source codes learned and practiced during the course of **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Specifically, this repository focuses on implementing the **Dijkstra** algorithm - an important algorithm in the field of finding the shortest path.

## Introduction to Dijkstra's algorithm
The **Dijkstra** algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative weights. This algorithm is widely used in problems related to path optimization, such as GPS positioning systems, computer networks, and many other applications.

### Main features of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.
- Use priority queue to optimize performance.
- Ensure correctness with graphs with non-negative weights.
